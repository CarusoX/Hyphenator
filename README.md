# Hyphenator

Hyphenation does not correctly work in all devices and browsers. This library will let you hyphenate text via JS. 
Hyphenation provided by this library is far from perfect, but good enough for most usecases.

For now we provide a single hook called `useSoftHyphenation`.

This hook will only add hyphens to words than don't fit the viewport, since our target are **really** long words (probably autogenerated or something). It will also recalculate the correct hyphens when 
the element resizes. Keep in mind this does hyphenates **anywhere** on the word.

This hook receives the reference of the element, and the text that you want to display in it.

You can see it in action in [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/reverent-tdd-gmh2md?file=/src/App.tsx) codesandbox.

We also provide `SoftHyphenatedText` which is a simple span that uses the hook explained before.
